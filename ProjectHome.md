# [RogueAndroid](http://rogueandroid.info/) #

RogueAndroid is a fast paced tile based role-playing game for Android devices based on the classic game Diablo. RogueAndroid provides an easy-to-use interface including "swiping" technology to view other sections of the map, "touch" technology to attack and travel, and  "auto pickup" of items to increase attack and defense bonuses.

In RogueAndroid, the gameâ€™s quest is to search the dungeon for the Red Dragon and to slay it. Many dangerous enemies are encountered along the way and a fight is always just around the corner. Magic potions can be used to heal and restore hit points lost during battles with monsters. Other items such as swords and shields can be used to raise attack and defense to increase the chance of defeating the Red Dragon and winning the game.

Currently RogueAndroid supports three character classes: warrior, ranger and mage and two monster types: dragon and orc. There are various items supported including swords, helmets, shields, and healing potions.

RogueAndroid is built using Rokon, an Android OpenGL game engine, Android SDK, Java 1.6, a newly developed tile engine, and a completely integrated testing suite.
